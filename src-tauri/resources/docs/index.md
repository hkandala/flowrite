# flowrite

## what is flowrite

flowrite is a markdown editor with built-in AI agent support. write, edit, and collaborate with AI agents directly in the editor — agents can read your docs, chat with you, leave comments, and make edits in place. connect any compatible agent like Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or Gemini CLI and start collaborating immediately.

## why flowrite

working with AI agents on documents today is fragmented. you write in one app, switch to your agent's terminal to ask for edits, copy the output back, paste it in, review the diff manually, and repeat. context is lost, flow is broken, and you spend more time managing the back-and-forth than actually writing.

flowrite was built to fix this. it brings AI collaboration directly into the editor — agents can read your files, suggest changes, leave inline comments, and respond to your feedback, all without leaving your writing environment.
