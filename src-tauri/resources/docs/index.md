# flowrite

## what is flowrite

flowrite is a markdown editor with built-in AI agent support. write, edit, and collaborate with AI agents directly in the editor — agents can read your docs, chat with you, leave comments, and make edits in place. connect any compatible agent like Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or Gemini CLI and start collaborating immediately.

## why flowrite

AI agents have changed how we work. markdown has become the default format for everything from documentation to project specs to knowledge bases, and agents are increasingly part of the writing and editing process.

but the current experience is fragmented. you write in one app, switch to your agent's terminal to ask for edits, copy the output back, paste it in, review the diff manually, and repeat. context is lost, flow is broken, and you spend more time managing the back-and-forth than actually writing. flowrite was built to fix this — bringing AI collaboration directly into the editor so you never have to leave your writing environment.
