# getting started

this guide walks you through installing flowrite, launching it for the first time, and trying out the core features.

## installation

download the latest version of flowrite for macOS from the [releases page](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/flowrite/releases). open the `.dmg` file and drag flowrite to your Applications folder.

## first launch

when you open flowrite for the first time, it automatically creates a `~/flowrite` directory. this is where all your markdown files are stored. you'll see the workspace with three main areas:

* **file tree** on the left — browse and manage your files
* **editor** in the center — write and edit markdown
* **right panel** — AI chat and comments (toggle with `⌘⇧L`)

## quick tutorial

### 1. create a file

press `⌘N` to create a new file. give it a name and start writing. flowrite supports full markdown — try typing `#`  for a heading, `**` for bold, or `-`  for a list. you can also use the floating toolbar that appears when you select text, or type `/` to open the slash command menu. save your file with `⌘S`.

### 2. chat with an AI agent

open the AI chat panel with `⌘⇧L`. if you have a compatible agent installed on your system (like Claude Code, OpenCode, or Gemini CLI), flowrite will automatically detect it and make it available in the agent selector at the top of the chat panel.

select an agent and type a message — for example, ask the agent to help you improve your document. the agent can read your files and suggest changes. you can also press `⌘L` to add a file reference to your message, giving the agent context about what you're working on.

> **tip**: if you don't have an agent installed yet, see [working with AI agents](./guides/working-with-ai-agents.md) for setup instructions, including how to get started for free with OpenCode.

### 3. add a comment

select some text in the editor and press `⌘D` to add a comment. type your comment and submit it. comments appear in the comments panel on the right side.

you can also ask an AI agent to review your document and leave comments — the agent's comments will show up alongside yours in the same panel. reply to comments to start a discussion thread, or resolve them when they've been addressed.
