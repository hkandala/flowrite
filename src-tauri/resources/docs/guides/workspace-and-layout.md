# workspace & layout

flowrite uses a flexible three-panel layout that you can customize to fit your workflow.

## panel layout

the workspace is divided into three main areas:

* **file tree** (left) — browse and manage your files
* **editor** (center) — write and edit documents
* **right panel** — AI chat and comments

each panel is resizable — drag the borders between panels to adjust their width.

## toggling panels

show or hide panels to focus on what matters:

| panel     | shortcut |
| --------- | -------- |
| file tree | `⌘⇧E`    |
| AI chat   | `⌘⇧L`    |

## tabs

each file you open appears as a tab in the editor area. you can:

* click a tab to switch to that file
* use `Ctrl+Tab` and `Ctrl+⇧+Tab` to cycle through tabs
* use `⌘1` through `⌘9` to jump to a specific editor group
* close a tab with `⌘W`
* right-click a tab for options: close, close others, close tabs to the right, close all, or close all saved tabs

tabs with unsaved changes show a dot indicator.

## split view

you can split the editor area into multiple groups to view and edit several files side by side. drag a tab to the edge of the editor area to create a new split.

## zen mode

press `⌘⇧=` to toggle zen mode, which maximizes the editor and hides all other panels. this gives you a distraction-free writing environment. press `⌘⇧=` again or press `Esc` to return to the normal layout.

## full width mode

press `⌘⇧-` to toggle full width mode, which expands the editor to use all available horizontal space. this is useful for wide documents or tables.

## multi-window support

you can open multiple flowrite windows to work on different parts of your workspace simultaneously. each window has its own set of tabs and panel configuration.

## command palette

press `⌘P` to open the command palette. type to search for files in your workspace by name — results are filtered as you type with fuzzy matching. select a result to open that file.

you can also type an absolute path (starting with `/` or `~`) to open any markdown file on your system, even outside the `~/flowrite` directory.
