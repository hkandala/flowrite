# comments & collaboration

flowrite has a built-in comment system that works for both you and AI agents. add comments to any part of your document, start discussion threads, and let agents participate in the review process.

## adding comments

select any text in the editor and press `⌘D` to add a comment. type your note and submit it. the commented text is highlighted in the editor so you can see which parts have active comments.

you can also add comments from the floating toolbar — select text and click the comment button.

## viewing comments

comments appear in the comments panel on the right side of the workspace. each comment shows:

* the commented text (what you selected)
* the comment content
* who wrote it (you or an agent)

the comments panel shows a badge with the total number of comments on the current document.

## discussion threads

reply to any comment to start a discussion thread. this is useful for back-and-forth conversations about specific parts of your document — whether with yourself (for notes) or with AI agents.

## resolving comments

when a comment has been addressed, you can resolve it. resolved comments are hidden from the main view so they don't clutter the panel.

## AI agent comments

AI agents can interact with comments in two ways:

### agents leaving comments

ask an agent to review your document, and it can leave comments on specific sections. for example, you might say "review this document and leave comments on anything that could be improved." the agent's comments appear in the same panel alongside yours.

### agents replying to comments

you can also write a comment and ask an agent to respond to it. this is a natural way to get feedback on specific parts of your writing — highlight a paragraph, leave a comment like "is this section clear?", and let the agent reply in the thread.

## comment workflow tips

* use comments to mark sections that need work — they serve as inline todos
* ask an agent to review your whole document at once and leave feedback on multiple sections
* resolve comments as you address them to track your progress
* comments are saved with the document, so they persist across sessions
